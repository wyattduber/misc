# Description

This is a script that I wrote to sent a HTTP request to textbelt.com to send a text of my choosing to my beautiful wife. I would set it before nighttime, and then it would run this script overnight and send the text.

# How to Use

All you need to set to use this program are the parts in the code where I surrounded the text in `<>`, because I removed those parts for privacy reasons. Then you would edit the message.txt in the src/ directory (or set it to a message file in a seperate location) and run the program!
