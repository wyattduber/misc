# auto-paper.sh

This is a script that I wrote to autodownload paper.jar files from the [PaperMC Repo](https://papermc.io) and remove existing ones and place them in a seperate folder. This is to be run every day (or as often as you want to update).

# geyser.sh

This is a script that I wrote to automate the downloading of the latest geyser-spigot.jar build. This is because geyser updates and I can't often update my server every day, and it gets the latest jar before the server restarts so that bedrock clients can ontinue to join with minimalized delay. This works very similarly to the `auto-paper.sh` file.

# a.sh

This is a script that I wrote to combine all of my ssh aliases into one file, easy to access when I pull up a terminal. I have all of the aliases configured in the ~/.ssh/config so that I could techincally just do `ssh ea` by hand, but I like this menu version more.
