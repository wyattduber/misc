# Swift and Objective-C

This is a collection of all of the random iOS projects that I attempted to make and experiment with when I first started coding. Pretty much all of these projects are extremely rudimentary and unfinished. I first got started coding when I was about 13, and Xcode was where I got my start. I first made a calculator app, and then I tried remaking different versions of the apps that I played a lot at the time, like flappy bird, piano tiles, space invaders, etc. You can see that the code is pretty rudimentary and not good. 

I will not be making README files for any of those projects to get more info as that would be excruciating and I just don't see the point since many of these projects are not finished and not good.
